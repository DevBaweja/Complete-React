### 
Firebase live-reload style of event handing

Idea of subscriptions
Observable - RxJS

next,error,complete

Essentially there are just these three methods
that is passed to stream of data or observable

Rxjs

### Promise Based
fetch(
    'https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/crown-clothing-3518d/databases/(default)/documents/collection'
)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(collections => console.log(collections));
then catch 

### Async call in redux

redux-thunk
Add thunk as middleware in store

if redux-thunk middleware is enabled, any timr we dispatch fn instead of object
middleware will call that fn with dispatch method itself as an first argument
