### Context API

The Context API is a neat way to pass state across the app without having to use props. The Context API was introduced to allow you to pass state (and enable the state to update) across the app, without having to use props for it.

# Creating new context

import { createContext } from 'react';

const CollectionsContext = createContext(INITIAL_STATE);

(mapStateToProps)
# Consuming context with Consumer Component

import CollectionsContext from '../../contexts/collections/collections.context';

<CollectionsContext.Consumer>
{
    collections => {
        return jsx;
    }
}
</CollectionsContext.Consumer>

Wrap it around where we want to use state

# Consuming context with useContext

import { useContext } from 'react';

const collections = useContext(CollectionsContext);

(mapDispatchToProps)
# Setting Actions in Context

We need to have component state
<CollectionsContext.Provider value={this.state.user}>
</CollectionsContext.Provider>

Consumer looks for Provider in tree
