### React Router

Thing is that in routing
Browsers works around concepts of urls

However initially it was problem to mimcs same scenario(as in case of back buttons) as there are no actual urls

React Router libraries uses History Api internally

npm i react-router-dom

### 
In index.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

Router is component that will be wrapped around App


ReactDOM.render(
    <Router>
        <App />
    </Router>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);

###
To anchor in any file

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
<Link to="\"> Go to Home </Link>

###
In App.js
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

<Switch>
    <Route exact path="/" component={Home}>
    <Route path="/dashboard">
        <Dashboard />
    </Route>
<Switch/>

There component come from pages folder


### Router
BrowserRouter as Router is used to specific that routing is to be implemented

### Switch & Route
It is like if else in routing

<Route exact={true} path="/" component={Home}/>

path is for url
It is string

component is to specific component
We can also enclose component in Route tag

exact is for path
if only exact then it is considered to be true

<Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
<Route path="/about" component={AboutMe} />

If we don't use exact then both pages will be displayed on '/about'

However in case of Switch it will display first that matches path
<Switch>
    <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
    <Route path="/about" component={AboutMe} />
</Switch>

Without exact in about 
'/about/me' will still display about


### Simple Routing


const TopicDetail = (props) => {
    console.log(props);
    return <h1>Topic Detail</h1>;
};
<Switch>
    <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
    <Route exact path="/topic" component={Topic} />
    <Route path="/topic/:id" component={TopicDetail} />
</Switch>

URL Parameters
/:id

Each component when routed receive properties
history
location
match

match.isExact to get if it will exact match or not
match.params are parameters of url
match.url is url that is exactly matched

location.pathName is url type into url bar
location.search are query of url
location.hash gives hash value

All of these location can also be taken by window

##

In case of Link(<Link to="/">) vs Anchor(<a href="/">)
Anchor redirect to specific link
Link don't redirect to specific link. It also mimcs it

With Anchor page is re-render
With Link component are unmounted and mounted again

Link and props.history

<Link to="/topic">Topic</Link>
<button onClick={() => props.history.push('/topic')}>Topic</button>

### withRoutter() and Props Tunneling/Drilling

Here in react routing it only passes values of 
history
location
match
to component in Route

So in order to get access to further in tree (childrens) we need to pass these values as props to next child compoennt in tree

This is called props Tunneling/Drilling

You can get access to the history objectâ€™s properties and the closest <Route>'s match via the withRouter higher-order component. withRouter will pass updated match, location, and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders.

export default withRouter(MenuItem)

 renderMenu = () => {
        return this.state.sections.map(({ id, ...other }) => <MenuItem key={id} {...other}   />);
};

Use this destructing to pass argument with exact name as props

const generateUrl = () => {
    history.push(`${match.url}${linkUrl}`);
};

Point is when we want generate item which point to different url

Everything is passed to it from container list above it

and withRouter item get access to history,location,match
And also to avoid props tunneling/drilling

history.push(`${match.url}${linkUrl}`)
It is done so that with any url it will do it work
